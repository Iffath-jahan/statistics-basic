    "Q1. What is Statistics\n",
    "Ans: statistics is the science of collecting ,organizing,and \n",
    "Analyzing data\n",

    "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "Ans: 1. Descriptive statistics: it consist of organizing and summarizing the data. ex: age=12,34,50,90,67\n",

    "2. ordinal scale data: ranking and order matters and difference cannot be measured. Ex:qualifications phd, Be, masters, bsc\n",
